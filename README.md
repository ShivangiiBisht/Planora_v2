# Planora

Plan your time. Focus better. Stay consistent.  
Planora is a web-based study planner that combines scheduling, calendar visualization, and a Pomodoro focus timer into a single, distraction-free experience.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Planora helps users structure their study routine by organizing tasks across time and supporting deep-focus work sessions. Instead of juggling multiple apps for planning and focus, Planora brings everything into one clean interface.

Users can plan what to study, when to study it, and stay focused while doing so — making consistency easier to maintain.
